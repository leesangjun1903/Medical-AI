  1.  Lower-Dose reduction Pediatric CT reconstruction : 적은 방사선량으로 데이터 추출하여 최적화된 CT 이미지 재건축
  2.  Metal artifact reduction techniques : CT 이미지의 결함 문제 : 배터리 노화, 인체 속 다른 물질 출력으로 인한 이미지 결함 해결
  3.  motion-induced blur in cone-beam computed tomography(CB-CT) : CB-CT 를 사용했을 때 먼 거리에서 뿌연 현상(blur) 발생 문제
  4.  segmentation task of oral CBCT image with Deep Learning : 딥러닝을 이용하여 이미지의 인체기관 위치 식별
  5.  3D image stitching with CB-CT : CB-CT 를 이용하여 추출한 3D 이미지 연결(스티칭)
